## Reporting Security Problems

If a Security Problem is found on the code or the repository, please contact directly me by my social media (check it at my [profile page](https://github.com/Mestre-Tramador#social-media)). Please do not create an Issue or a Pull Request, let treat it privately first to then arrange the most efficient solution.
